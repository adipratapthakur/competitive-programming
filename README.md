### Q2. Reverse Words in a String (LeetCode 151)  

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.  
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.  
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.  

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.  

Example1:  
Input: s = "the sky is blue"  
Output: "blue is sky the"  

Example2:  
Input: s = "  hello world  "  
Output: "world hello"  
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.  

Example3:  
Input: s = "a good   example"  
Output: "example good a"  
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
